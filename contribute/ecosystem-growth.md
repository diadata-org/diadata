# üåê Ecosystem Growth

When DIA launched in 2018, it leveraged a community of incentivised developers to source and validate data. This was only the start ‚Äî a core part of DIA‚Äôs mission is to decentralise the organisation and enable a diversely skilled community of like-minds that self organises to create value for the project. In short: To become a DAO.

DIA now presents the next iteration of the DIA DAO: **A formal framework to enable the DIA community to support the growth and development of DIA and to earn rewards while doing so**. The inception of this ‚ÄòWork DAO‚Äô is a major milestone in the journey to a fully matured DAO as it DIA to further leverage its decentralised workforce.

Join the DIA DAO and start your journey by joining the [DIA Discord Server](https://discord.gg/zFmXtPFgQj) and [submitting the application form](https://forms.gle/j8X2JsuZou8p45zHA).
