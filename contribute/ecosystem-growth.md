# 🌐 Ecosystem Growth

When DIA launched in 2018, it leveraged a community of incentivised developers to source and validate data. This was only the start — a core part of DIA’s mission is to decentralise the organisation and enable a diversely skilled community of like-minds that self organises to create value for the project. In short: To become a DAO.

DIA now presents the next iteration of the DIA DAO: **A formal framework to enable the DIA community to support the growth and development of DIA and to earn rewards while doing so**. The inception of this ‘Work DAO’ is a major milestone in the journey to a fully matured DAO. In this post, we will unbox how we plan to raise and operate DIA’s decentralised workforce.
