We are looking for a Go developer that can provide scrapers of a [websocket and REST API].

We reliably want to get trades in realtime from [NAME] exchange. This trade information is then written into our databases using a specific format. We have an existing framework for this which allows us to parametrize the scraper. We work with Go and expect that the scrapers will work concurrently and efficiently.
The URL of the API can be found here: [ADD URL].

The submitted work has to include the API scraper as well as a pull request with the respective documentation of the added code.
