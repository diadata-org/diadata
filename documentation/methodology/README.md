In this section we describe the methodologies of data collection and processing. We dedicate proper subsections to data points which involve more complex processing. For an overview of all data points available along with their methodology, see subsection [Overview of Data Points](https://docs.diadata.org/documentation/overview-of-data-points). In general, our goal is always to be as close to the data source as possible and to work with the highest precision possible.
