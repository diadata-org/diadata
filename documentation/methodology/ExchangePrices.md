# Pricing Methodology of Crypto Exchange Quotations

In this document you can find information about our pricing data.

## API Location
Our crypto exchange quotations can be retrieved from our API using <https://api.diadata.org/v1/quotation/[TLA]>, with TLA being the short name of a currency.
As an example, the current Bitcoin price is stored at <https://api.diadata.org/v1/quotation/BTC>.

## Outliers and Market Manipulation
Detecting and excluding outliers and market manipulation is an important data processing task, especially in small and (somewhat) intransparent markets.

We calculate our cryptocurrency-spot-prices using 120-second moving average (SMA).
In order to create reliable pricing, we also exclude data points & sets that lie outside of an [acceptable range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range#Outliers) relative to theÂ [interquartile range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range) of all data points.

This will be constantly improved over time with crowd-driven algorithmic improvements from the traditional financial space, taking into consideration that high volatility is aprt of the cryptocurrency space.
