# Contributing

We welcome every contributor who wants to add something to our project.
If you want to submit a feature request or a bug report please submit an issue on our issue page.
In case you want to add code, read the documentation about the area you want to contribute to and generate a pull request after you finished programming.
We will then take a look at your contribution and eventually integrate it.
